# CSharp By Example
Inspired by [gobyexample](https://gobyexample.com/), this site is a clone of that one (Thanks for the CSS!) except re-written from scratch in csharp (obviously).

I was primarily motivated by my own students. They spend a lot of time watching tutorial videos (including my own) and not enough time simply reading and reverse-engineering code. Having a resource to send them with concise, annotated code is an excellent resource for that refresher.
