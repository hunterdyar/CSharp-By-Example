# CSharp By Example
Inspired by [gobyexample](https://gobyexample.com/) except re-written from scratch in csharp (obviously). Go By Example is by [Mark McGranaghan](https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample) and this site uses much of the css from it. In addition to being a clone of, you know, it's whole core concept.

I was primarily motivated by my own students. They spend a lot of time watching tutorial videos (including my own) and not enough time simply reading and reverse-engineering code. Having a resource to send them with concise, annotated code is an excellent resource for that refresher. I found GoByExample.com to be very useful as I learned go, and I wished I could send them to csharpbyexample. It didn't exist... and here we are.

## Suggestions
Pull requests are welcome! I am primarily a Unity&C# developer, which can have a different way of doing things than "idiomatic" C#. I am welcome to criticism and change. I know who the site is for - my first-year undergraduate students with a semester's prior programming experience. I believe that it wil also be useful to a lot of other people too!
